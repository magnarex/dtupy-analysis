# Batch
**Important!**

Please use the `make_submit.py` file to make the condor executable and the condor submit.

NOTE: For the time being, the script is only available for job submission @ CIEMAT's HTCondor servers.

## Options
- **`-f`**: force submission of job to the batch.
- **`--cpus`**: number of CPUs to request for the job.
- **`--alias`**: alias for the job to be stored as in the `log/` and `jobs/` folders.
- **`--conda`**: path to the conda environment to use.
